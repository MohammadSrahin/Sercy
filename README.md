# Sercy

Sercy is an app focused on mental health, it lets you speak with strangers anonymously to talk about
the issues you're currently having and seek advice, and optionally you can also talk with a certified
therapist with a small fee.

## Installing using the APK

You can find the APK in the releases of this page.

## How to login as a therapist

After getting the home screen, go to the Therapists section and click on the LOGIN button.

You could use these credentials for testing:

* Email: user123@email.com
* Password: 1234567

## Process of signing up as a therapist:

**Early ideas**

Suggestions would be appreciated.


The sign up process goes like this:
first the therapist has to fill a form, in that form we ask for the CV, certificates and ID, along with some few questions.
If we see that they're a good fit, we would contact them and arrange an interview, if they pass the interview we would put them on the list.


## If you encounter bugs

Please make an issue in the GitHub page, and we will look into it and get it fixed ASAP.
